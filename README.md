# HTML, CSS & JavaScript Practice 🚀

This repository contains my complete learning journey of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, including theory notes, basic concepts, and hands-on practice code.

I created this repo to build a **strong foundation in frontend development** by practicing core concepts step by step instead of jumping directly into frameworks.

---

## 📌 Purpose of this Repository

- To understand **core web fundamentals** deeply
- To practice concepts with **real code examples**
- To track my daily progress and learning consistency
- To build a habit of using **Git & GitHub properly**
- To create a reference repo I can revisit anytime

This repository focuses on **learning by doing**, not just watching tutorials.

## 🛠 How This Repo Is Organized

- Theory and examples are written in index.html, style.css, main.js
- Practice tasks are done in practice.html, practice.css, practice.js
- For proper projects of html css and js a different repo is created.
- Code is written clearly and simply for easy understanding
- Focus is on **clarity over complexity**
- No frameworks used — only **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

---

## 📈 Learning Approach

- Learn concept → write code → break it → fix it
- Practice basics repeatedly until comfortable
- Push code regularly to build consistency
- Improve logic and confidence step by step

This repo represents **progress, not perfection**.

---

## 🎯 Future Plans

- Add small frontend mini-projects
- Improve JavaScript problem-solving skills
- Refactor old code as my understanding improves
- Eventually move to frameworks like React and Typescript after mastering basics
