Javascript controls logic and behaviour of websites.
Js is a single threaded interpreted dynamic language which runs line by line and moves fast
Variables - containers used to store data values - let, var, const
Let value can be changed, const value remains constant.
Data types - define the nature of data stored. Primitive and non-primtive.
Primitive data types - include String Number Boolean Null Undefined
Non Primitve Complex data types - include Arrays Obljects Functions
Arrays - single variable used to store an ordered collection.
Objects - used to store collections of related data & functionaility/ key-value pair.
Operators - include + - * / %= == === > < >= <= && || !
If/else statemnts - conditional statements which execute if specified condition is true or false.
Loops - structures that repeat a block of code multiple times until a specified condition is met.
Functions - Set of stmts that performs a task or calculates a value.Takes some input and return an output.
Callback function - A function passed as an argument to another function.
Anonymous function - A function that does not have a name associated with it./ Defined inline, used for one-time tasks.
Async function - Multiple things are running parallely at the same time, context switching with each other, runs in parts.
Sync function - Sequential, only one thing is happening at a time.
Javascript can context witch using async functions.

Examples - 
Variables - let, const,
 let a = 1; console.log(a);
Loops - for(let i=0; i<5; i++){
	console.log(i);
Array - let fruits = [apple, orange, banana]
Objects - Key:Value pair
	let person = { name:aditya, age:21, gender:male }
Functions Calculate Sum(n)=
